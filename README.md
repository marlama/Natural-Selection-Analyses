# Natural-Selection-Analyses
This is a repository with a complete pipeline for carry out Natural Selection analysis using the following testes:
PBS, xpEHH, iHS, CLR, Tajima'sD, and GRoSS.

Besides a three steps mothod to select outliers in a natural selection analysis.

1)In the first step I construct a input for UCSC annotation table with the just 1%, 0.5%, and 0.1% most significant results for the following statistical tests: PBS, xpEHH, iHS, Tajima'sD, CLR, and GRoSS.

2)In the second step I select just the genes that are common between different analised populations.

3)In the next step I compare our selected results with other natural selection browsers, like popHuman, 1kgp browser, and Introgression Results.

I also add a script to construct visual graphs of the general distribution of Natural selection results.
